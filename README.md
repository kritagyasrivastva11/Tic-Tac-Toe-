# Tic-Tac-Toe-

**Overview**

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s a two-player game where players take turns marking either "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

**Features**

-> Two-Player Mode: Play with another person by taking turns.
-> Interactive UI: Visual feedback for player moves.
-> Win Detection: Automatically detects and announces when a player wins or if the game results in a draw.
-> Restart Option: Reset the game at any time with a reset button.
-> Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.

**Technologies Used**

HTML5: Structure of the game interface.
CSS3: Styling the game board and layout.
JavaScript: Game logic, player interaction, and win/draw detection.

**How to Play**

1) The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2) Player 1 (X) makes the first move by clicking any available cell.
3) Player 2 (O) takes the next turn by selecting another cell.
4) The game alternates turns between the two players.
5) The game checks for a win condition after each move (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal).
6) If a player wins, a message will display announcing the winner.
7) If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game declares a draw.
8) To play again, click the Reset button to restart the game.
